**Purpose of App**

Designed to help low-income BCIT students to offer their professional skills to other BCIT students to freelance/tutor in exchange for money, credit for your work (add to your portfolio/resume), and/or exchange of equal service (instead of getting paid, you can ask your client if there is a freelancing/skill they can give you). 

You can make as many posts (only visible to other BCIT students) for different freelancing/tutoring sessions like Designing Logos or giving English Lessons, for example. Services provided on this app are cheaper, more accessible to students who are in the same campus, and will allow students to practice their skills for the work-world without the same pressure.

Since freelancing and tutoring are done primarily online, this app is focused for now on the BCIT students in the Burnaby campus, allowing users to:
- meet in person
- network with students from different faculties
- create new friendships
- have the option to exchange skills/services instead of receiving payment (ex. They can teach you how to use a program or tutor/freelance something for you)
- practice and calmly freelance without the pressure of being perfect
- be able to showcase what your freelancing skills were used for in the other students' projects and add it to your resume
